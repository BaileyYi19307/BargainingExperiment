<p>You have finished the tutorial.</p>
<p>You will now interact 3 times with <strong>real participants</strong>.</p>

<p>The participants with whom you will interact will be randomly determined at the beginning of each round.</p>

<p>The other participants in your group will always be referred to on your screen as "Participant A" and "Participant B".</p>

<p>At the end of the experiment, the computer will randomly select <strong>two</strong> rounds from three total rounds. You will be paid based on your earnings in those rounds.</p>
<p>You may now ask questions about the instructions on this page and the way the program works.</p>

<p>If you have a question, please raise your hand and ask it <strong>quietly</strong> when an experimenter comes.</p>

<p>If you have no questions, please click "Continue" and wait for the <strong>real rounds</strong> to begin.</p>
